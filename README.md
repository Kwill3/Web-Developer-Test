## Libraries used and why
- I used the SASS library to develop my style files because it helps save a lot of keystrokes by nesting styles and makes responsive web designing easier. 
- Javascript is used for registering click events (burger menu) and deploy the menu dropdown.

## How long did you spend on this project?
A day.

## Which Browsers/Devices or Virtualisation services did you check the application in?
- Desktop:
Firefox, Chrome and Brave.

## Anything you want to tell us?
- Features:
Hover effects on navbar links, the blue buttons, footer links and also the socials icons.
On-click event handling on burger menu which activate and deactivates dropdown and background shadowing.

- Decisions:
The design asset featured a MENU link on the navbar for mobile screen but I found it redundant as the burger menu is essentially the same thing so I decided not to include it in my project. It is also weird that it doesn't exist on the desktop screen so removing it will make the site more clean and uniform.
